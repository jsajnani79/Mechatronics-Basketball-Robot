# Basketball Playing Robot

This is the Arduino source code to control a robot to dunk balls into a basket. This was done for the Mechatronics class project (ME210). The entire code can be found in the bigballer folder where bigballer.ino is the entry point for the robot. More details about the robot can be found at our <a href="http://www.jankyjawnski.weebly.com">project website</a>.
